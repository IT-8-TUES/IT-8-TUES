# HTML Basics

## 🏗️ Structural & Semantic Tags

These tags define the broad layout and meaning of the page content.

- "<title>": Sets the name of the webpage displayed on the browser tab.
- "<link>": Connects the HTML file to external resources, most commonly CSS stylesheets.
- <header>: A container for introductory content, such as logos or the main title.
- <nav>: Specifically designates a section intended for navigation links.
- <main>: Encapsulates the unique, primary content of the body; there should only be one per page.
- <section>: Groups related content together into a standalone thematic block.
- <div>: A generic block-level container used for styling or layout purposes when no other semantic tag fits.
- <footer>: Contains information meant for the bottom of the page, like copyright or contact info.

## 📝 Text & Typography Tags

These tags control how text is structured and emphasized.

- <h1>: The most important heading on the page; usually the main title.
- <h3>: A medium-level heading used for sub-sections.
- <h6>: The lowest-level heading, used for minor labels or small sub-sections.
- <p>: Defines a paragraph of text.
- <br>: Creates a single line break without starting a new paragraph.
- <em>: Adds semantic emphasis to text, which browsers typically render as italics.
- <b>: Bolds text to draw attention to it without implying extra importance.
- <u>: Underlines text (use sparingly to avoid confusion with links).
- <blockquote>: Used for long quotes taken from another source; usually indented.
- <mark>: Highlights text with a "marker" effect (yellow background by default).
- <span>: An inline container used to wrap small bits of text for specific styling.

## 🖼️ Media & Interactivity

Tags used for images, links, and user interaction.

- <a>: The anchor tag; creates a hyperlink to another page or a section of the current page.
- <img>: Embeds an image into the document; requires src and alt attributes.
- <button>: Creates a clickable button often used to trigger JavaScript actions.

## 📋 Lists & Tables

Used for organizing data and collections of items.

- <ul>: Defines an unordered list (usually shown with bullet points).
- <ol>: Defines an ordered list (usually shown with numbers).
- <li>: Represents a single item inside a list (used within <ul> or <ol>).
- <table>: The main container for displaying data in rows and columns.
- <tr>: Defines a single row within a table.
- <td>: Defines a standard data cell within a table row.
